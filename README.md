## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the website locally, ensure you have a modern web browser installed (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge). No additional software or dependencies are required.

### Running Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BrendenDack/BrendenDack.github.io.git
   cd BrendenDack.github.io
   ```

2. **Open in Browser**

   Locate the `index.html` file in the project directory and open it with your preferred web browser. You can do this by double-clicking the file or by right-clicking and selecting "Open with" followed by your browser choice.

   Alternatively, you can serve the website using a simple HTTP server. For example, with Python installed:

   ```bash
   # For Python 3.x
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

   Then, navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.
